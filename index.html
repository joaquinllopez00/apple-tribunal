              When the original iPhone was released, I was 7 years old. Too young to even watch a PG-13 movie without a
              parent, yet I still heard about the device that broke into the cellphone market and changed the
              expectations for a cellphone. Four years later I saved my money and bought my self an iPod touch -
              starting my long relationship with Apple's products.

              I was never afforded a Mac until I was 17 and had saved enough money to buy one for myself, and after a
              few months of power-using - it thrusted me further into my commitment to Apple and the unmatched
              productivity I found when using their products.

              Growing up, I was always an avid music listener. It was the only way I felt I could escape reality. As I
              grew older however, I found that I enjoyed music much more as a soundtrack to life which would serve as
              ambient noise throughout the day. When the Airpod Pros released, I was excited because for once, you could
              wear earbuds that could stay in your ear playing music while you could still hear others and have
              conversation. The implementation of active-noise-cancelling in these earbuds truly changed the way I
              experience music.

            To say that Steve Jobs didn't play an essiential role in creating some of the most life changing products
            would be a lie. He was now only the driving force behind some of the most influential and ground-breaking
            products in the world - he was also a role-model for many people who were or are looking to break into tech.
